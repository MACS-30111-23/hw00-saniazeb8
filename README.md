Title: *Brief Biography*

#About Me

Hi, My name is Sania Zeb. I am from pakistan, and I am an **economist** by profession. I have a dynamic experience in research and development industry especially considering the public sector of Pakistan. I aim to polish my computational skills to empower myself with cutting edge technology in social sciences which will enable me to take on the complex macroeconomic issues. 

#Projects

Some of my *key research interests* are listed as follows:
1. Income Inequality 
2. Political Economy and It's Impact on Macroeconomic Fundamentals 
3. Incidence of Taxes on Economic Agents

#Summary

GitHub is one of the new things I came across at the University of Chicago. At first I felt it was extra work, but overtime I figured its usefulness especially while dealing with a dynamic assignment or in a big class. 

#Workflow
I followed each and every instruction step by step and broke down the text in steps to understand it better. Firstly, I created headers and then I wrote my name in bold and then I wrote the title in italics. I was not sure of the placemnet of the brief biography but I think it all flows with the list of research interests and the whole profile overall. It has been an informative exercise for me to get more comfortable with python and programming.

#NewLearning

Each day I learn a lot of new things in the computational / progarmming modules, however, embedding images was something amazing that I just learned and it makes it so efficient. As I am thinking about data visualization, where we have to present graphical trends of various economic variables, and it can be done this way.
